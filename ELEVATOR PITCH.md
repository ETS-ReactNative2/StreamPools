Digital assets are becoming more and more ubiquitous. One of the inherent trends regarding that is the fact that there are, and will likely be even more people receiving tokens as compensation for their work. Not only stablecoins, but also tokens of the projects and protocols they work for.

Such situation requires new solutions that are natively propelled by the blockchain technology. These solutions have a chance to be more optimized towards common good of the payer and beneficiary.

As a society we've been dealing with money in form of discrete payments for generations. Humankind has been using physical money for so long that it got everyone entrenched in an archaic mental model. However with blockchain technology money can become real-time.

What if such recurring payments like salary can be set up once and the assets will flow second by second to the destined person anywhere in the world? What if the assets instead of idly waiting to be paid out may be able to earn interest in the meantime?

That's not all. Such a solution would have direct benefits to the contractors either.

Thanks to the continuous settlement, one can payout due part of their salary any time. Imagine that you earn $10k a month. This means that in the middle of the month you can pay out $5k, or you can pay out $0.0038 every single second. No need to wait for the payday, because pay is everyday.

What if you want to save money that you earned? You can do it easily by not doing anything. You can let the assets stay in the contract and earn interest for yourself. If you need money, you can pay it out anytime!
