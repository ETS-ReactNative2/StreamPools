My name is Kasper Pawlowski, I'm a postgraduate Blockchain Development student at George Brown College in Toronto.

Originally, I graduated from aerospace engineering, however, after a few years of work in the sector I decided to requalify and change my career path to a more dynamic industry.

Over the years, I have worked in multinational teams scattered around the world which gave me a strong teamwork ethic and communication skills so important to work remotely.

Currently, as an intern at Euler XYZ, a British startup building a permissionless lending protocol on Ethereum, I am exposed to both back-end and front-end development.

Although the technological stack differs, my previous experience as a safety-critical software engineer gave me a lot of transferrable skills that I can apply in my everyday work. 

I believe that blockchain is the technology that has a real chance to disrupt the world we know. I made the decision - I want to be a part of this disruption.
